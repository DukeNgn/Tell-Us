# ConUHacks 2020 Submission: Tellus's Mental Heath Challenge

A submission for ConUHacks2020 hosted by HackConcordia. Our team consists of Krishna Dube, Andres Daniel Oros Halas, Duc Nguyen and Minh Tran.

## What does our web app do:

To assist patients in self-diagnosing mental health issues and giving a tentative diagnosis. The app can then point troubled people to professional psychiatrists in Montreal.

## Requirement:

* \>= python3
* pip 

To install the required pip modules:

```
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

## Future Development:
- [x] Basic python gui with I/o handler and JSON file parsing.
- [ ] Remove the python backend to move to PHP + HTML/CSS web app.
